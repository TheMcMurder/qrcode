# TODO

## Summary of Current Problem

- The web example (`examples/web`) imports the WASM package (`@qrcode/wasm`) generated by `wasm-pack` in `bindings/wasm/pkg`.
- TypeScript (`tsc`) fails to find the module or its type declarations during build, even though Vite can resolve it at runtime with an alias.
- Symlinking `pkg` into `node_modules` works but is not robust for teams or CI, as symlinks are not persisted in git and require manual or scripted setup.

## Chosen Solution: File Dependency

- Use a file dependency in `examples/web/package.json`:
  ```json
  "@qrcode/wasm": "file:../../bindings/wasm/pkg"
  ```
- After every `wasm-pack build`, run `pnpm install` in `examples/web` to update the local dependency.
- This ensures both TypeScript and Vite can resolve the module and its types from `node_modules`.
- This approach is cross-platform, robust, and works for all developers and CI environments.

## Next Steps

- Update `examples/web/package.json` to use the file dependency for `@qrcode/wasm`.
- Document the workflow: after building WASM, always run `pnpm install` in the web example.
- (Optional) Automate this with a script or Turborepo pipeline step.
